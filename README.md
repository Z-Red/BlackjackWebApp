# BlackjackWebApp

Allows a user to play a blackjack variation in their browser using a very simplistic design. There exists two version: one with bare HTML, and another with minimal CSS.

The first version is made without CSS and uses a single JS file to control the application and interface with the server.

The second version uses both Bootstrap and some custom CSS to structure and design a user interface. To try something new, ReactJS is used to control the DOM and application, as well as interface with the server.


### Note
As it is currently, the server that hosted the backend code is no longer in use and thus the application is rendered unusable. Still, the code remains here as a point of reference.
