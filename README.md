# BlackjackWebApp

Allows a user to play a blackjack variation in their browser.

One version is made without CSS and uses a single JS file to control the application and interface with the server.

The second version uses both Bootstrap and some custom CSS to structure and design a user interface. To try something new, ReactJS is used to control the application and interface with the server.
